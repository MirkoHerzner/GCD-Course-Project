# GCD-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R script run_analysis.R assumes that all the relevant data have been downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, unzipped and put in the working directory.

It will perform all the merging, tidying, summarizing and output steps asked for in the Course Project Description. It performs its tasks using the dplyr package.
